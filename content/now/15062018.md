We're getting ready for the big [Rheinkirmes][rheinkirmes] here in Dusseldorf. It's a 10-day festival with rides, music, food and drinks. Every day from dawn to dusk.

And the World Cup has just started yesterday, with Russia beating Saudi Arabia 5 to 0. What a game!

## Learning

A lot of my spare time is focused on learning [React][reactjs]. I gobble up as much as I can from [egghead.io][egghead.io] and other readings online.

My [React Native][react-native] app is finally done and I'm just waiting for approval to release it on the Google Play Store. The app uses [MobX State Tree][mobx-state-tree] and [NativeBase][nativebase] components.

## Open source

[frontwerk][frontwerk] is coming along nicely. I've recently updated its dependencies to the latest versions of ESLint, Jest, Rollup, Webpack4 (wohoo). No major issues yet.

I feel like another piece of work that I've open sourced and that I use literally every day needs a bit of love: my Edge theme, a code editor theme available for [Sublime Text 3][edge-sublime] and [Vim][edge-vim], as well as [iTerm2][edge-iterm2]. I'm currently refactoring some bits and spicing up some styles. It will be grand!

## Talking

I picked up another opportunity to give a talk on something I absolutely love: [Gatsby.js][gatsby] and [Netlify][netlify]. The Dusseldorf ReactJS Meetup is hosting us at the end of this month. I seriously cannot wait to share what I've learned along the way with Gatsby.

## Sport

I've joined a gym! It was about damn time! I'm going there every other day and following a training plan from [DevLifts.io][devlifts].

## Reading

I've fallen a bit behind and have not been able to pick up a book in almost a month. I'm currently reading [The Daily Stoic][daily-stoic] by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman - one page every day.

I want to get back on the horse here.

## Work

With [@frylondon][fry-twitter], we're putting together the basis of a design system. It's a lot of work and it's really exciting.
