We're getting ready for the big [Rheinkirmes][rheinkirmes] here in Dusseldorf. It's a 10-day festival with rides, music, food and drinks. Every day from dawn to dusk.

Germany is out of the World Cup! There's been a lot of disappointment around me lately regarding this! Chin up!

## Learning

A lot of my spare time is focused on learning [React][reactjs]. I gobble up as much as I can from [egghead.io][egghead.io] and other readings online.

My [React Native][react-native] app is finally done and I'm just waiting for approval to release it on the Google Play Store. The app uses [MobX State Tree][mobx-state-tree] and [NativeBase][nativebase] components.

I've started another RN app, for fun. I can't wait to share the progress with you.

## Open source

[frontwerk][frontwerk] is coming along nicely. I've recently updated its dependencies to the latest versions of ESLint, Jest, Rollup, Webpack4 (wohoo). No major issues yet.

I feel like another piece of work that I've open sourced and that I use literally every day needs a bit of love: my Edge theme, a code editor theme available for [Sublime Text 3][edge-sublime] and [Vim][edge-vim], as well as [iTerm2][edge-iterm2]. I'm currently refactoring some bits and spicing up some styles. It will be grand!

## Talking

I gave my talk [Gatsby.js][gatsby] and [Netlify][netlify] yesterday at the ReactJS Meetup in Dusseldorf. It's been an amazing experience. I'm very grateful to everyone who showed up and to the organizers for putting everything together! You can see the slides for my talk [here][the-great-gatsby-slides].

## Sport

I've joined a gym and am sticking consistent with it! I've gone about 3 times per week for the past month and a half. I've stepped it up a bit and am now aiming for 5 times a week, early in the morning before everyone starts their day and it gets crowded. I feel fantastic because I dropped a few pounds, and also because it's the thing that gets me energized in the morning and ready for my day! I'm still following the training plan from [DevLifts.io][devlifts].

## Reading

I've fallen a bit behind and have not been able to pick up a book in almost a month. I'm currently reading [The Daily Stoic][daily-stoic] by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman - one page every day.

I want to get back on the horse here.

## Work

With [@frylondon][fry-twitter], we're putting together the basis of a design system. It's a lot of work and it's really exciting.
