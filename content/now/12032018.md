Spring is finally showing signs in Dusseldorf, Germany. Yey!

## Learning

A lot of my spare time is focused on learning [React][reactjs]. I gobble up as much as I can from [egghead.io][egghead.io].

My [React Native][react-native] app is finally done and I'm just waiting for approval to release it on the Google Play Store. The app uses [MobX State Tree][mobx-state-tree] and [NativeBase][nativebase] components.

My next steps are to unify the native and web app versions and have them share as much of the code as possible. I'm learning [Lerna.js][lerna] and making use of [Yarn Workspaces][yarn-workspaces] in order to do this.

## Open source

I've finished the brand new documentation website for [frontwerk][frontwerk]. It's live and available at [frontwerk.org][frontwerk.org]. I'm using [Gatsby.js][gatsby] to build it and [Netlify][netlify] to host it. I am absolutely in love with both Gatsby and Netlify.

## Reading

I've finished [Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days][sprint] by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky and Branden Kowitz and I've started [A Brief History of Time][hawking] by Stephen Hawking.

## Work

With [@frylondon][fry-twitter], I'm working on two great products.

Kaizen is an e-portfolio system that powers learners to track their progress throughout their career and collaborate with others through a proved regular and continual feedback system. It is a web application that runs on any device.

Haiku is an ever evolving content management system specifically designed for universities and professional bodies.
