The big [Rheinkirmes][rheinkirmes] is underway here in Dusseldorf. It's a 10-day festival with rides, music, food and drinks. Every day from dawn to dusk.

France won the world cup! Allez les bleus!

## Learning

A lot of my spare time is focused on learning [React][reactjs]. I gobble up as much as I can from [egghead.io][egghead.io] and other readings online.

My [React Native][react-native] app is finally done and I'm just waiting for approval to release it on the Google Play Store. The app uses [MobX State Tree][mobx-state-tree] and [NativeBase][nativebase] components.

I've started another RN app, for fun. I can't wait to share the progress with you.

## Open source

I've updated my **Edge Theme**! Yay! I am so excited to share this with the community! There's a ton of changes in there, and most importantly, Edge now supports [VSCode][edge-vscode] and [Alfred][edge-alfred]! VSCode has been something always on my mind and I never really got around to it. After reading [Sarah Drasner][sarah-drasner-twitter]'s tutorial on [Creating a VS Code theme][creating-a-vs-code-theme], I bit the bullet! It's been an amazing experience developing the theme for this editor! Alfred came on a whim shortly after :)

## Health

It's now become a major part of my life. Five days a week, Monday through Friday, early in the morning, I bike to the gym, workout and then bike back. In the evening, I do a short jog before bed. I feel fantastic! I highly recommend having a routing you follow. I'm still following the training plan from [DevLifts.io][devlifts].

I'm also on a new diet - Keto diet. I must say, the kilograms are dropping, and most importantly, I feel great about myself again. Working out and a diet, combined with daily meditation, have worked wonders for my wellbeing!

## Reading

I started Stephen King's [The Stand][stephen-king-the-stand]. About a quarter of the way through, and loving it! [The Daily Stoic][daily-stoic] by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman is still how I start my day.

## Work

With [@frylondon][fry-twitter], we're putting together the basis of a design system. It's a lot of work and it's really exciting. I shared an article about the [10 Principles of Good Product Design][10-principles-good-product-design] on Medium.
