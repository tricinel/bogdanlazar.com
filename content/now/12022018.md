I live in Dusseldorf, Germany. It's [carnival][carnival] here and everyone is out and about. The Germans value their holidays, sometimes with too much beer and wursts.

## Learning

I'm currently working with [React][reactjs]. Coming from [AngularJs][angularjs], I find React a breath of fresh air. [egghead.io][egghead.io] has very nice tutorials and I try to learn as much as I can. I'm no stranger to [Redux][redux] and I've recently started learning [RxJS][rxjs], [MobX][mobx] and [MobX State Tree][mobx-state-tree].

I'm also working on a native app with [React Native][react-native]. Details as it develops.

In the past months, I fell in love with functional programming, a very different way of thinking about your code, especially when you come from an Object Oriented background. [RamdaJS][ramdajs] is marvelous.

## Open source

I don't do as much open source as I would like to. Right now, I'm working on a toolset to help frontend developers abstract away all the processes and configurations involved in properly working in a Javascript project. Testing, linting, formatting your code, bundling it for production - these are configurations that tend to stand in the way of getting started.

My solution is [frontwerk][frontwerk]. I work with it and on it almost every day.

My other project is a set of beautiful themes for code editors and the terminal. Currently, I support [Sublime Text 3][edge-sublime] and [Vim][edge-vim], as well as [iTerm2][edge-iterm2], with Atom and VSCode in the works. The theme is called Edge.

## Work

With [@frylondon][fry-twitter], I'm working on two great products.

Kaizen is an e-portfolio system that powers learners to track their progress throughout their career and collaborate with others through a proved regular and continual feedback system. It is a web application that runs on any device.

Haiku is an ever evolving content management system specifically designed for universities and professional bodies.

## Exercise

I'm a little round around the waist, I must admit. I've taken up running as a way to stay healthy and maybe also lose some weight. I'm following a training program from Garmin and post my runs on my Strava account.

## Reading

Last month, I've read quite a bit on stoicism, with Seneca's letters being the last in the series for now.

* [Letters from a Stoic: Volume I][letter-from-a-stoic] by Lucius Annaeus Seneca
* [A Guide To The Good Life: The Ancient Art Of Stoic Joy][guide-to-the-good-life] by William B. Irvine
* [Meditations][meditations] by Marcus Aurelius, the Gregory Hays translation

I plan on starting [Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days][sprint] by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky and Branden Kowitz quite soon.
